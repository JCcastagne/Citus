Most of us have been in a situation where we were racing against the clock at some point. Having only x amount of time, trying to get ready or getting something done, constantly looking at your phone to see how time you have left.

This is where the concept for this app came from.
> Citus: latin for quick, rapid, or in a swift manner.

This software has all of the features of a standard countdown timer app, plus the ability to announce the time left. You can choose wether it's enabled or disabled, as well as how often you want the app to announce the time left.
